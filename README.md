## MERN Stack:
The MERN stack is very similar to the popular MEAN stack. The only difference here is that the MEAN stack is making use of Angular to build the front-end web application and the MERN stack is using React instead.

The MERN stack consists of the following technologies:<br />
`Node.js`: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js brings JavaScript to the server<br />
`MongoDB`: A document-based open source database<br />
`Express`: A Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js<br />
`React`: A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces<br />
